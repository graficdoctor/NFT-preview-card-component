## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The past month, I've been repeating a lot of theory. This has helped me to understand the concepts behind html and css a lot more. In solving this challenge, I was more aware of each decision I made.

### Continued development

I need to learn how to work with svg's. I also need to get used to work with positioning. I'm at the moment struggling to put that theory in practice. Which just means, I need to practice a lot more.

### Useful resources

- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40292168/color-overlay-on-hover-image) - Somehow I couldn't get `background-blend-mode` to work, so I looked for a solution on Stackoverflow. Hoping it would also work on the svg. I adapted the solution to this excercise and managed to get the overlay to work.
